### Hi, I'm Ayrton Hora.

Computer Scientist by [Federal University of Sergipe (UFS)](https://www.ufs.br/), Brazil.

I currently a Software Engineer and acting as Tech Director at [Sergipe State Attorneys General Office](https://pge.se.gov.br/).

Both areas were the ones that captured me mostly. On my hard disk I'll never forget some markable feelings like my first S.E discipline and my first contact as a I.T Team Leader. 
Software Engineering, Databases and Cloud Computing instigates me. Eventually I'll be breaking through the Back-end world, also dealing with Networks, Algorithms and DevOps culture. 

For me, technology don't make sense without human beings. Abstract, plan, implement, implant and cativate!

## On Progress:
1. Software Engineer career
2. High level English certification
3. Portfolio building
4. People leadership and management knowledge

## Planned:
 - Law posgraduation degree;
 - Master degree on Software Engineering;

 - Cloud Engineer Certification (AWS, IBM, Google Cloud); and
 - Be a collaborator of Open Source Projects.
