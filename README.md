# Ayrton Hora (@ayrton-hora)

### Hi, I'm Ayrton, call me TonTon or just Ton.

Currently a Computer Science student at [Federal University of Sergipe (UFS)](https://www.ufs.br/), Brazil.

With approximately four and a half years of college, I currently work as a System Analyst and also play the role of Product Owner and I try to get the most out of both experiences in this part of my journey. 

Software Engineering, Databases and Cloud Computing are the areas that captivate me the most. Eventually I'll be breaking through the Back-end world and DevOps.
